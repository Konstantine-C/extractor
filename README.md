# extractor
Extractor I made to make my life easier at work. 
In our platform, zip files you downloaded from the portal have long names, so when you extract them, the path becomes more than 255 characters. 
With this little script, I rename the folders by removing unnecessary text and prefixes and then I extract the needed formats into seperate folders within the root folder.
